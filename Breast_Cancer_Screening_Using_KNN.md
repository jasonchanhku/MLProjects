Libraries Used
==============

    library(gmodels) #cross table function
    library(ggvis) # better visualization
    library(qtlcharts) # correlation plot
    library(class) #execute KNN

<br />

Objective
=========

To predict whether patient's extracted cells from the mass are malignant
or benign using the machine learning model **kth Nearest Neighbour
(KNN).** This machine learning model will study and learn from
measurements of biopsied cells from women with abnormal breast masses.

<br />

Step 1: Data Exploration
========================

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository at <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml>. This data was
donated by researchers of the University of Wisconsin and includes the
measurements from digitized images of fine-needle aspirate of a breast
mass.

Features
--------

From the data preview above, the target variable and features can be
identified:

**Target Variable**  
The target feature is obviously **diagnosis** with levels "M" for
malignant and "B" for Benign. Of the 569 examples, we have the following
proportion:

    round(prop.table(table(wbcd$diagnosis)), digits = 2)

    ## 
    ##    B    M 
    ## 0.63 0.37

**Features**  
The other 30 features comprise of the mean, standard error, and worst
for the following:

-   Radius
-   Texture
-   Perimeter
-   Area
-   Smoothness
-   Compactness
-   Concavity
-   Concave Points
-   Symmetry
-   Fractal Dimension

Visualization
-------------

Data visualizaition can help to identify some preliminary connections
and trends about the dataset. For illustration purposes, only
**radius\_mean**, **area\_mean**, and **smoothness\_mean** will be
compared in the visualizations.

### Correlation Plot

Comparing correlation of **radius\_mean**, **area\_mean**, and
**smoothness\_mean**.

Preliminary Insights
--------------------

After inspecting from the visualizations and getting a glimpse of the
dataset. It can be observed that:

-   Malignant cells have higher radius, area, and smoothness
-   Benign cells have lower radius, area, and smoothness

<br />

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
==========================

It is necessary to **normalize** the dataset hen using kNN because of
it's dependency on distance. As the ranges for smoothness is 0.11 and
for area is 2357.5, the **distance impact on area is much more than
smoothness.**

Normalization
-------------

Traditional normalization will be used on the features. An anonymous
function is created and will be applied to the dataset as below:

    normalize <- function(x)
      return ((x - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x)))

Applying the normalization function to our features in the dataset:

    wbcd_n <- as.data.frame(lapply(wbcd[3:32], normalize))
    wbcd_nfull <- cbind(wbcd[1:2], wbcd_n)
    summary(wbcd_n$area_mean)

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##  0.0000  0.1174  0.1729  0.2169  0.2711  1.0000

As seen in the summary above for one of the feature **radius\_mean**, it
is confirmed that the features has been normalized.

Data Preparation
----------------

Data preparation involves creating a training set and a test set from
our dataset. Because the dataset is already randomly sorted, there is no
need to randomly sample 2/3 for training and 1/3 for test.

The training and test labels will also be prepared in this section

The training and test set will be divided as the following:

-   First 469 entries used as **training set**
-   Last 100 entries used as **test set**

<!-- -->

    wbcd_train <- wbcd_n[1:469,]
    wbcd_test <- wbcd_n[470:569,]

    #Preparing train and test labels
    wbcd_train_labels <- wbcd[1:469, 2]
    wbcd_test_labels <- wbcd[470:569, 2]

<br />

Step 3: Model Training
======================

The knn() function from the **class** package will be used here. As for
the parameter k, a value of k = 21 will be chosen as sqrt(469) is 21.66.
Bare in mind that the nearest odd number is chosen to avoid ties.

    wbcd_pred <- knn(train = wbcd_train, test = wbcd_test, cl = wbcd_train_labels, k =21)

<br />

Step 4: Model Evaluation
========================

To evaluate the model's accuracy, the CrossTable() function is used:

    CrossTable(x = wbcd_test_labels, y = wbcd_pred, prop.chisq = FALSE)

From the CrossTable, it is clear that only the **accuracy rate of the
model is 98%** as there were only 2 entries wrongly predicted.

The two errors wrongly predicted are labelled as **false negatives**.
This is arguably the most dangerous error as patients might think they
are cancer free but in reality, they are not.

Step 5: Model Improvement
=========================

To improve the model's accuracy and reduce its false negative, **Z-Score
Transformation** is tested. Z-Score has no min and max value. Hence, one
might think malignant tumours might grow uncontrollably and more weight
is put in its distance calculation.

    #Z-Score Normalization
    wbcd_z <- as.data.frame(scale(wbcd[c(-1,-2)]))

    #train and test set
    wbcd_z_train <- wbcd_z[1:469, ]
    wbcd_z_test <- wbcd_z[470:569, ]

    #train and test labels
    wbcd_z_train_labels <- wbcd[1:469, 2]
    wbcd_z_test_labels <- wbcd[470:569, 2]

    #model training
    wbcd_z_pred <- knn(train = wbcd_z_train, test = wbcd_z_test, cl = wbcd_z_train_labels, k = 19)

    #model evaluation
    CrossTable(x = wbcd_z_test_labels, y = wbcd_z_pred, prop.chisq = FALSE)

Conclusion
==========

In this case, Z-Score transformation **does not help improve the model,
considering that the model already has a high accuracy rate of 98%** and
it gives back the same accuracy rate as traditional transformation.

Unlike many classification algorithms, k-NN does not do any learning. It
simply stores the training data verbatim. Unlabeled test examples are
then matched to the most similar records in the training set using a
distance function, and the unlabeled example is assigned the label of
its neighbors.

In spite of the fact that k-NN is a very simple algorithm, it is capable
of tackling extremely complex tasks, such as the identification of
cancerous masses.
